# HTML5-AudioVideoPlayer
A wrapper around html media player
This is a library modified from friend Brian

Two wrapper for audio and video players. The main difference them and the rest of media players in html are:
1. They are neat and simple
2. Starting time and end time can be passed to the media player API.
